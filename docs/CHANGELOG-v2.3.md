## Major v2.3 enhancements

#### iCloud3 now works with Apple ID Verification and supports iCloud 2-factor-authentication
This is significant update to iCloud3. It supports true 2fa verification using the 6-digit Apple ID Verification Code sent from Apple when you log into iCloud.

When iCloud3 starts, you will get the standard Apple Login warning and the 6-digit Apple ID Verification Code notification. YOU WILL USE THAT 6-DIGIT CODE IN THE ID ENTRY SCREEN ON THE HA NOTIFICATIONS AREA. Select the Verification Code entry window like you always have from the HA Notifications area and enter the 6-digit code. This will create the Trusted Device token like other apps and browsers. iCloud3 will then continue starting as it usually does. Go [here](/1-getting-started?id=authenticating-your-icloud-account) for more information on entering the 6-digit authentication code.

#### The Find-my-Friends and Family Sharing tracking methods have been combined

You no longer need to assign a tracking method to use iCloud Location Services. The Find-my-Friends (fmf) and the Family Sharing (famshr) have been combined into a single tracking method (icloud) and operates on a per device basis. When iCloud3 starts, all the devices in iCloud account are retrieved and matched with those in the configuration file. They are retrieved from the *FindMy People* list, the *FindMy Me* screen (your device), and the *Family Sharing List*. Each phone will automatically select the appropriate tracking method based on how the phone's parameters are configured in the following manner:

- If the email address is specified for the phones and all phones are in the *FindMy* list, the location of all the phones in the *FindMy* list are located with one request. 
- If the email address is specified for the phones and one phone is not in the *FindMy* list but all are in the *Family Sharing List*, the location of all of the phones in the *Family Sharing* list are located with one request. Actually, iCloud locates all phones in the list, whether-or-not the phone is being tracked. If you have a large list, it will take a slightly longer for iCloud to locate all the phones than the above method.
- If the email address is specified for the phones and one phone is not in the *FindMy* list and another phone is not in the *Family Sharing List*, then it will take two requests to locate all the phones being tracked.

#### Enhancement to the method of configuring the devices to be tracked 

The *track_devices* configuration parameter has been depreciated and it is recommended that the *devices/device_name* parameter be used. Although if the *track_devices* parameter can still be used to specify the devices, it will no longer be updated to support new parameters. 

The following example shows how the track_devices is converted to the devices/device_name parameters.

From:

```
track_devices:
  - gary_iphone > gary456@email.com, gary.png, _app
  - lillian_iphone > lillian678@email.com, lillian.jpg, noiosapp
```

To:

```yaml
devices:
  - device_name: gary_iphone
    email: gary456@email.com
    name: Gary
    iosapp_suffix: -app
  - device_name: lillian_iphone
    email: lillian678@email.com
    name: Lillian
    picture: lillian.jpg
    noiosapp: True
```

Other parameters include:

- *iosapp_entity* to specify the device_tracker.entity_id to be used for the device.
- *zone* to specify additional zones to be used in the tracking calculations.



## Other Changes

- **New Configuration Parameter**
  *display_zone_format: name/title/fname/zone, Default: name*

  This parameter indicates how the zone should be displayed in the device_tracker.[DEVICENAME] states field and on the Event Log. The zone is formatted as follows:
  
  - name - A reformatted zone name. Examples: 'the_shores' is displayed as 'TheShores'
  - title - A reformatted zone name. Example: 'the_shores' is displayed as 'The Shores'
  - fname - The zones Friendly Name. Example: 'The Shores Development'
  - zone - The actual zone name is displayed. Example: 'the_shores' is displayed as 'the_shores'
  
- **New Configuration Parameter:**

  *2sa_verification: True/False, Default: False*

  This parameter forces the 2-step-authentication procedure used in previous versions of iCloud3 instead of the 2-factor-authentication using the native Apple ID Verification Code released in iCloud3 v2.2.2.

- **Changed the priority order of searching for the config_ic3.yaml  configuration file to:**  

  This is based on the *config_ic3_file_name* parameter specified (or not specified) in *configuration.yaml*.

  1. *DirectorySpecified/FileNameSpecified*

  2. /config/*FileNameSpecified*

  3. /config/custom_components/icloud3/*FileNameSpecified*

  4. /config/config_ic3.yaml

  5. /config/custom_components/icloud3/config_ic3.yaml

- **Breaking Change - *icloud3_lost_phone* service**

  The *device_tracker.icloud3_lost_phone* service call as changed to *device_tracker.icloud3_find_iphone_alert* to match what the service call actually does and eliminate any confusion with the Apple's lost phone process. This service call uses the iCloud native process when using the Family Sharing tracking method and sends an alert (with sound) when using the Find-my-Friends and iOS App tracking method.

- **Battery Status**

  If the battery state is less than 10%, the polling interval is set to the *stationary_zone_interval* value (default is 30-minutes), regardless of the distance from home. If it is less than 5%, and the distance from Home is less than 1km, it will be set to 15-seconds. This change should help preserve battery life when the phone is in a low power mode.

- **Event Log Actions**

  - Reorganized the list of Actions
  
- Enhanced the information displayed in the Event Log when iCloud3 starts -- available devices, errors during initialization, current operations, status checks, etc.
  - Added the *Reset iCloud Interface* Action that removes the current iCloud communications sessions and restarts the iCloud interface program (pyicloud_ic3.py) that handles iCloud3 Location requests. It will:

    1. Rename the current cookies and session files in the */config/.storage/icloud* directory to save them.
    2. Create new cookies and session files.
    3. Request iCloud authorization which will send the Apple Id Verification Code notification to the trusted phone with the 6-digit Verification Code
    4. Set up the configuration form in the HA Notifications area for entering the 6-digit verification code.
    5. Restart iCloud3 and reinitialize the iCloud Interface program.  

- Added additional error checking and reporting 

  

## v2.3.1 - v2.3.3 Bug Fixes

##### v2.3.3 Bug Fix Update (2/19/2021)

- The *track_from_zone* parameter is used to track devices from the home zone and an additional zone(s). It was not being accepted and creating an error, resulting in iCloud3 not tracking any devices.

##### v2.3.2 Bug Fix Update (2/10/2021)

- The *Name* parameter was not being decoded correctly due to a bug introduced in iCloud3 v2.3.1.
- Added a *device_type* parameter to override a value extracted from the *device_name* parameter.
- Updated the iCloud3 version number which was not updated in the v2.3.1 release.

##### v2.3.1 Bug Fix Update ( 2/8/2021)

- The name specified in the *Settings App > General > About > Name field* (Gary-iPhone) can now be specified on the *device_name* configuration parameter. Previously, the value in the HA device_tracker entity id had to be specified (gary_iphone).
- The *zone* parameter in configuration file for a device/device_name should be *track_from_zone*.
- The zone's name was being displayed instead of the friendly name when  *display_zone_as: fname* parameter was specified.
- When the devicename was duplicated in the iCloud Family Sharing List, the older device was being tracked instead of the newer device with the same name. The older devicename probably does not exist anymore so no location information was returned for it.
- When optimizing the device's tracking method. The Family Sharing tracking method was always selected for all devices if they were all in the Family Sharing list and in the Friends list on the FindMy App. In this situation, the Find-my-Friends tracking method should be assigned to each device.
- The *unit_of_measurement* type ('mi' or 'km') would be displayed correctly but the value being displayed was always the miles value when *unit_of_measurement: km* was specified in the config_ic3.yaml. 
- Cleaned up the iCloud3 code - Removed the old 2sa Authentication code, removed other obsolete code, cleaned up some messages, removed zone_name_1/2/3 and last_zone_1/2/3 sensors left in by mistake.
- Updated the iCloud3 documentation.

- Fixed a problem calculating the default *old_location_threshold* value.
- Fixed a problem where iOS App was reporting a state change when it had not changed.
- Fixed a problem that occurred when the device's name was 'iPhone'.
- Fixed other minor problems.
